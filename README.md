# windows-sudo
windows-sudo lets you run an arbitrary program with elevated privilege on Windows.
Remember, this is *different* from running the program as the Administrator user.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/ysmu/windows-sudo/releases/latest
2. Unzip it and run ```install.bat```

## Example
```sudo cmd```

```sudo regedit```

## System Requirement
All functions of windows-sudo *should* be compatible with all 32bit and 64bit builds of Windows newer than Windows XP SP 2 (included). That being said, I will only be maintaining windows-sudo for Windows 10. windows-sudo has been tested on the following platform:

- Windows 10 x64 Build 1607
- Windows 10 x64 Build 1703
